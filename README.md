# Introduction to Quantum Computing with Python and Qiskit

**Author:** Giuseppe Arcucci  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Alessandra Rotundi  
**Academic Year:** 2023/2024  
**Course:** Introduction to Quantum Computing

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project explores the fundamental principles of Quantum Computing, focusing on the simulation and execution of quantum circuits using Python and Qiskit. It includes the construction and visualization of basic quantum gates and circuits, as well as execution on IBM’s real quantum computer (`ibmq_lima`).

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Quantum states and qubits  
- Pauli gates: X, Y, Z  
- Identity gate  
- Hadamard gate  
- Superposition and measurement  
- Quantum circuit design with Qiskit  
- Execution on real quantum hardware (`ibmq_lima`)  
- Job submission and results retrieval using Qiskit

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Qiskit (`pip install qiskit`)  
- IBM Quantum Experience account  
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Install Qiskit**  
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit
✅ Learning Outcomes
Understand basic quantum logic and quantum gates
